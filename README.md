    3.5 Strings (explain type, memory allocation, etc.)
        3.5.1 Console I/O
        3.5.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: teach him how to greet
            3.5.2.1 HOMEWORK: Teach KESCHA greet you in Uzbek!

        3.7.2 PROFESSIONAL JARGON: What is feature? 
        3.7.3 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Add a new feature that calculates how much you are older than him. He is 1 years old.
            3.7.4 Explain that now we have added a new feature to KESCHA the older version of the app is lost and we didn't track the developement process. This should be enough to understand the importance of source control 
    3.8 GitHub and Visual Studio Integration 
        3.8.1 Register to GitHub
        3.8.2 Connect Visual Studio 2022 to GitHub account 
        3.8.3 Deploy KESCHA (CalculatR is homework) 
        3.8.4 Deploy CalculatR
    3.9 Char (explain type, memory allocation, etc.)
        3.9.1 What is ASCII?
        3.9.2 Project 2: KESCHA: Add a new feature that tranlates chars into ASCII equivalent. Let the student know how KESCHA's 'brain' operates. Make the student feel that he started to understand technology. 
        3.9.3 PROFESSIONAL JARGON: What is commit?
    3.9 Bool (explain type, memory allocation, etc.)
    3.10 Logical Operators 
        3.10.1 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: teach comparison (commit changes to GitHub)
    3.11 If
        3.11.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: teach military age calculation (commit changes to GitHub)
    3.12 Switch (make simple menu)
        3.12.1 PROFESSIONAL JARGON: what is refactor?
        3.12.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: At this stage, the main method of KESCHA is pretty messy. At this stage of refactoring, we will divide responsibilites using "switch" clause. "Switch" should enable basic menu for the user to choose from 
            3.12.3 HOMEWORK: Make the same changes with CalculatR
    3.13 WHILE loop (simple program to demonstrate what is it)
        3.13.1 Infinite loop
        3.13.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Add a new feature to ask whether the user wants to close or restart the application. 
    3.14 FOR LOOP (simple program to demonstrate what is it)
        3.14.1 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: At this stage, the main method of CalculatR is pretty messy. At this stage of refactoring, we will divide responsibilites using "switch" clause. "Switch" should enable basic menu for the user to choose from
        3.14.2 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: teach arithmetic and geometric progression.
        3.14.3 Break/Continue
    3.15 Arrays
4. C# OOP
