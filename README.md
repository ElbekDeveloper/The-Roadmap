# The Roadmap

0. Blind-typing 

1. Hello, World! (the student uses dotnetfiddle.net playground to feel he can program!)

2. Tooling 

    2.1 Chrome  
    2.2 .NET Framework  
    2.3 Visual Studio 2022  

3. C# Basics  

    3.1 What is .NET? (show .net library files from c drive)  
    3.2 How C# works? (show diagram pipeline how c# code is transformed over time to machine code)  
    3.3 File extensions you need to know (DLL, EXE, CS)  
    3.4 Namespaces  

        3.4.1 What are they?   
        3.4.2 Naming convention
    3.5 Strings (explain type, memory allocation, etc.)  

        3.5.1 Console I/O
        3.5.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: teach him how to greet
            3.5.2.1 HOMEWORK: Teach KESCHA greet you in Uzbek!
    3.6 Numbers (explain type, memory allocation, etc.)  

        3.6.1 Console I/O of numbers and conversion between strings and numbers 
    3.7 Arithmetic Operations with numbers and strings   
    
        3.7.1 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: teach arithmetics 
        3.7.2 PROFESSIONAL JARGON: What is feature?

            3.7.4 Explain that now we have added a new feature to KESCHA the older version of the app is lost and we didn't track the developement process. This should be enough to understand the importance of source control 
    3.8 GitHub and Visual Studio Integration  

        3.8.1 Register to GitHub
        3.8.2 Connect Visual Studio 2022 to GitHub account 
        3.8.3 Deploy KESCHA (CalculatR is homework) 
        3.8.4 Deploy CalculatR
    3.9 Char (explain type, memory allocation, etc.)  

        3.9.1 What is ASCII?
        3.9.2 Project 2: KESCHA: Add a new feature that tranlates chars into ASCII equivalent. Let the student know how KESCHA's 'brain' operates. Make the student feel that he started to understand technology. 
        3.9.3 PROFESSIONAL JARGON: What is commit?  
    3.10 Bool (explain type, memory allocation, etc.)  
    3.11 Logical Operators

        3.12.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: teach military age calculation (commit changes to GitHub)
    3.13 Switch (make simple menu)  

        3.13.1 PROFESSIONAL JARGON: what is refactor?
        3.13.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: At this stage, the main method of KESCHA is pretty messy. At this stage of refactoring, we will divide responsibilites using "switch" clause. "Switch" should enable basic menu for the user to choose from 
            3.13.3 HOMEWORK: Make the same changes with CalculatR
    3.14 WHILE loop (simple program to demonstrate what is it)  
     
        3.14.1 Infinite loop
        3.14.2 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Add a new feature to ask whether the user wants to close or restart the application. 
    3.15 FOR LOOP (simple program to demonstrate what is it)  

        3.15.1 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: At this stage, the main method of CalculatR is pretty messy. At this stage of refactoring, we will divide responsibilites using "switch" clause. "Switch" should enable basic menu for the user to choose from
        3.15.2 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: teach arithmetic and geometric progression.
        3.15.3 Break/Continue
    3.16 Arrays  
4. C# OOP

    4.1 What is class?  

        4.1.1 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Create separate class for KESCHA.
        4.1.2 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Create separate class for  CalculatR
    4.2 What is method and method params?  

        4.2.1 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Create methods for each feature of CalculatR
        4.2.2 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 1 : KESCHA: Create methods for each feature of KESCHA
        4.2.3 What is parameter overloading?
        4.2.4 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Overload 'Greet' method to include custom greeting in users own language (latin alphabets)
        4.2.5 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Overload 'Sum' method to add 3 numbers instead of 2
        4.2.6 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Overload 'Sum' method to add 2 numbers (as before) but with different number type (before: int, now: decimal)
    4.3 What is object?

        4.5.2 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Get rid of fields and start assigning using properties
    4.6 Single-Responsibility-Prinsiple in Action (explain that Program class was running the project and holding logic. Now, logic is in its own classes.)  

    4.7 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Introduce Kasee with the same methods and properties as KESCHA. (Kasee is cat and KESCHA is parrot)  

        4.7.1 Show the code is repeated. Explain Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
        4.7.2 Implement inheritance that helps us follow DRY
    4.8 Explain that KESCHA (parrot) and KASEE (cat) greet differently.   

        4.8.1 What is virtual method? Implement virtual methods in parent class. (This is called POLIMORPHISM)
