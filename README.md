            3.7.4 Explain that now we have added a new feature to KESCHA the older version of the app is lost and we didn't track the developement process. This should be enough to understand the importance of source control 
    3.8 GitHub and Visual Studio Integration  

        3.8.1 Register to GitHub
        3.8.2 Connect Visual Studio 2022 to GitHub account

    3.16 FOR LOOP (simple program to demonstrate what is it)  

        3.16.1 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: At this stage, the main method of CalculatR is pretty messy. At this stage of refactoring, we will divide responsibilites using "switch" clause. "Switch" should enable basic menu for the user to choose from
        3.16.2 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: teach arithmetic and geometric progression.
        3.16.3 Break/Continue
    3.17 Arrays
4. C# OOP

    4.1 What is class?  

        4.1.1 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Create separate class for KESCHA.
        4.1.2 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Create separate class for  CalculatR
    4.2 What is method and method params?  

        4.2.1 PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Create methods for each feature of CalculatR
        4.2.2 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 1 : KESCHA: Create methods for each feature of KESCHA
        4.2.3 What is parameter overloading?
        4.2.4 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Overload 'Greet' method to include custom greeting in users own language (latin alphabets)
        4.2.5 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Overload 'Sum' method to add 3 numbers instead of 2
        4.2.6 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Overload 'Sum' method to add 2 numbers (as before) but with different number type (before: int, now: decimal)
    4.3 What is object?  

        4.3.1 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Create object of KESCHA class
        4.3.2 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 2: CalculatR: Create object of CalculatR class

        4.5.2 HOMEWORK: PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Get rid of fields and start assigning using properties
    4.6 Single-Responsibility-Prinsiple in Action (explain that Program class was running the project and holding logic. Now, logic is in its own classes.)  

    4.7 PROJECT 1: KESCHA: Introduce Kasee with the same methods and properties as KESCHA. (Kasee is cat and KESCHA is parrot)  

        4.7.1 Show the code is repeated. Explain Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
        4.7.2 Implement inheritance that helps us follow DRY
    4.8 Explain that KESCHA (parrot) and KASEE (cat) greet differently.

    4.11 What is struct? (explain value types and the reference types)
        4.11.1 When to use?
            ■ The type acts as a primitive type. Specifically, this means that it is a fairly simple type that has
            no members that modify any of its instance fields. When a type offers no members that alter
            its fields, we say that the type is immutable. In fact, it is recommended that many value types
            mark all their fields as readonly (discussed in Chapter 7, "Constants and Fields").
            ■ The type doesn’t need to inherit from any other type.
            ■ The type won’t have any other types derived from it.
